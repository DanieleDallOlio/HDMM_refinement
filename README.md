# Covering Hierarchical Dirichlet Mixture Models on binary data to enhance genomic stratifications in Onco-Hematology

This repository is currently under development, and we are working diligently to finalize the code. Stay tuned as we will be uploading the code soon.

Explainable models are particularly attractive nowadays since they have the advantage to convince clinicians and patients. In this work we show that a deeper understanding of the Hierarchical Dirichlet Mixture Model, a non-black box method, can lead to better data modelling. In onco-hematology Hierarchical Dirichlet Mixture Models typically help to cluster molecular alterations rather than patients. Here, an intuitive statistical approach is presented to tackle patient classification based on the Hierarchical Dirichlet Mixture Models outcome. Additionally, molecular alterations are usually modelled by Hierarchical Dirichlet Mixture Models as a mixture of multinomial distributions. This work highlights that the alternative Fisher's Non-Central Hypergeometric distribution can provide even better results and can give a higher priority to rare molecular alterations for patient classification.

Please check back later for updates and the availability of the code.
